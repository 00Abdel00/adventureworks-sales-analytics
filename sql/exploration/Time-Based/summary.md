# Time-Based Trends â€” Exploration Summary

## 1. Yearly Revenue and Order Count
We grouped sales data by year to assess overall growth:
- There was clear year-over-year growth between 2012 and 2013.
- 2011 and 2014 have lower totals, likely because the data for those years is partial.

| Year | Revenue           | Order Count |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| 2011 | 12,641,672.21     | 5,716       |
| 2012 | 33,524,301.32     | 21,689      |
| 2013 | 43,622,479.05     | 56,573      |
| 2014 | 20,057,928.81     | 37,339      |

## 2. Monthly Average Order Value
We computed the average order value month by month across the dataset. This revealed subtle seasonal trends and periods of higher average value. These will be explored further during dashboarding.

## 3. Orders by Day of the Week
We analyzed order volume per weekday:
- Monday had the highest order count.
- The rest of the week showed fairly uniform distribution.
- Weekends had slightly lower but still substantial activity.

| Day       | Orders |
|-----------|--------|
| Monday    | 4,875  |
| Wednesday | 4,591  |
| Saturday  | 4,483  |
| Tuesday   | 4,482  |
| Sunday    | 4,444  |
| Thursday  | 4,346  |
| Friday    | 4,244  |

This initial time-based exploration highlights a healthy, growing business with consistent weekly sales patterns and potential seasonal effects to explore visually.
